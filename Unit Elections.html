Semialachee Lodge 239 is proud to announce that our 2016 unit election period is now open. We will keep this open until May and invite all Scoutmasters to schedule a unit election anytime between now and May. We will be closing unit elections on late May in order to reconcile all election information and make sure that we have it prepared for summer camp. Below you will find information regarding eligibility requirements, unit election resources, an OA explanation video, and information on how to book your unit elections. This year we are requesting that you book your unit elections via email.

To schedule your unit election please use the email provided in the letter sent out to scoutmasters, or semialacheelodge@gmail.com

<b> IMPORTANT! If you have booked your election on the old scheduling system that used to appear on this page (prior to march 21st 2016), we do not have your information (due to a technical problem) and you will have to send an email to schedule your election! </b>
